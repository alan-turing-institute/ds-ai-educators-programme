00:25:12	Eric Atwell:	Why are there no University AI lecturers in the panel?  I thoguht we would learn about EDI in university teaching
00:25:40	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Matt Forshaw is the rep throughout üôÇ
00:26:38	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	But we are discussing EDI of diverse lens and what you can take back in your work
00:27:07	Eric Atwell:	I think Office for Students only help UK students - but most of our AI students are International
00:28:11	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Eric, Nick and I are bring the international aspect
00:29:31	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	bringing*
00:30:05	Andy MacLachlan:	hi Kate, are theses the scholarships you were referring to? How do you apply for a programme to be on the list - https://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-abroad/in-uk/scholarship-women-stem
00:30:26	Doschmund:	I couldnt catch the name of Nick's Organisation. Could you please add to the chat?
00:30:31	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	Hi Andy; here is the link: https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/skills-and-employment/postgraduate-conversion-courses-in-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/
00:30:37	Mishka Nemes (she/her) | Alan Turing Institute:	Neuromatch
00:30:39	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	Nick is from Neuromatch
00:30:47	Eric Atwell:	@Kate I meant your studentships are only for UK students, is that right? My AI students are mainly BAME female students from overseas
00:31:25	Kate Hazeldene, OfS:	More inforrmation about the programme and the schoalarships are available on our webpages here- https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/skills-and-employment/postgraduate-conversion-courses-in-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/
00:31:34	RYAN CROSBY:	I tried typing this in sli do but the question seems to long.
00:31:46	RYAN CROSBY:	It may aslo be a question for the end of the session as Nick may cover it
00:32:09	RYAN CROSBY:	I think this will be a question for Nick ‚Äì but if anyone else can input that would be great (and sorry it‚Äôs a ramble). Do you have any general advice on making assessment more accessible? Do you assess your courses? If so, how do you make those assessments accessible? For example, traditional exams to me aren‚Äôt accessible. Even when concessions are made, they don‚Äôt seem to be truly accessible. Do you have alternative assessments ‚Äì I would assume you aren‚Äôt constrained by exams / coursework as HE sometimes is? 

The rest of this message is ignorable, just an example ‚Äì 
With exams if we consider Autism ‚Äì exams could be difficult due to hypo/hyper sensory sensitivity, and I‚Äôm unsure how this can be changed to make this aspect of exams accessible. I‚Äôm still very new to researching making assessment accessible so sorry if this is a question that is already resolved?
00:32:57	Kate Hazeldene, OfS:	The eligibility criteria and application process are set by the individual providers who are delivering the scholarships and some may allow international students to apply but the priority is for UK students 
00:33:58	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	Ryan, I have added your question to the Slido but made sure it fitted the word count üôÇ
00:34:03	Eric Atwell:	@Ryan, do you think MCQs are accessible? eg in Blackboard, a Test cna have 20 questions each with 4 possible answers, studnt must select 1 (or more) correct answer.  Is this accessible for autisitc and other students?
00:34:21	RYAN CROSBY:	Thank you Ayesha 0 sorry for the ramble
00:34:37	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	Hi Eric, building on Kate's comments, I can certainly say from a Newcastle project perspective that we've seen very strong uptake in international leaners who are benefitting from the new programmes (which we wouldn't have been able to bring to market without OfS project). At Newcastle (and many providers do similar things) we offer 'pre-sessional' training to learners coming from other backgrounds, and mentorship opportunities with data leaders from industry. We are able to offer those benefits out to learners irrespective of whether they are home or international.
00:34:41	Eric Atwell:	MCQ also has the great advantage of scaling up to big classes, 200+ students
00:35:48	staalcu:	@Matt how do you manage such workload?
00:37:33	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	Slido can also be anonymous if you don't want to share your name!
00:38:46	staalcu:	I think the default is anonymous
00:38:51	RYAN CROSBY:	@Eric I think it depends on how the questions are structured, and if exams are necessary - I‚Äôve found exams rarely have any benefit to the student and is a better assessor of students memory recall, strategic learning and ability to work under pressure. I am a big believer that assessment should be for learning not 'of learning‚Äô. However I am aware that exams are very important to HE institutes and potential employers
00:39:19	Eric Atwell:	Malvika mentioned she put a link. - where? In slido? in hackmd? in zoom chat? (I only have a laptop screen and find it hard to tach several interfaces at once)
00:39:25	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	HackMD
00:39:36	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Last section has links from all of us.
00:39:54	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Do ask for any additional links that could be useful.
00:40:10	Mishka Nemes (she/her) | Alan Turing Institute:	https://hackmd.io/fQceWS7TSf6B-yQzrYatAw
00:40:12	Doschmund:	@Malvika - how do you elicit participation from the groups you mentioned? What appraoches do you take?
00:40:41	staalcu:	I asked a similar question in the slido
00:41:19	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	Hi @Staalcu, a very good question. Doing this well does have a not insignificant workload impact. We were lucky with the OfS funding which supported that staff time in the first year of the scheme, while we demonstrated the benefits of the activity. We've now been able to build this into our Business as Usual. We've found ways to ensure our pre-sessional training is complementary with the development of blended/online training which we use in other contexts.
00:43:07	staalcu:	@Matt, this sounds ideal! Do you have a good attendance of students and do these classes come with any form of credit or assessment?
00:43:59	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	@staalcu, around 30% of our total Data Science students participate (either to brush up on their skills, or to learn for the first time). We do formative assessment on learners' practice exercise, but it isn't formally credit-bearing.
00:44:23	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	It also runs remotely because many of our learners are unable to obtain visas to come to Newcastle before the start of term for pre-sessionals.
00:44:38	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Doschmund, this is one of our first reports that highlights how inclusiveness is centered in Open Life Science: https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/10/01/annual-report-part-1/
00:46:07	staalcu:	@Matt, thanks. Side note: staalcu is Luisa Cutillo by the way :-) It seems like I did not set up my name after all
00:46:42	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	We have documented some practical tips for online calls designed for inclusiveness: Yehudi, Y., Stack Whitney, K., & Sharan, M. (2020, November 24). Enhancing the inclusivity and accessibility of your online calls. https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/k3bfn
00:48:31	Doschmund:	@Nick, are there any specific consideration for Summer schools in terms of wider participations
00:49:58	Nick Halper:	I think one thing that people forget, and this is a current failure point of Neuromatch, is that summer break is not at the same time everywhere in the world.
00:50:28	Nick Halper:	You are inherently exclusionary by being a 'summer school' that only operates on summer break in Northern hemisphere.
00:50:47	Nancy Ruzycki:	I think it is important to build alliances also with lower school teachers who have access to local diverse students. How are pathways made available and accessible to local students? Many times we are bring in international students and not looking to build pathways to local students.
00:51:10	Nick Halper:	Similarly, summer schools are typically full time for several weeks. This is inherently exclusionary to people that can't take time off work or school to attend.
00:53:41	Doschmund:	@Malvika - very inspiring - how do you ensure that those students achieved the learning objectives?
00:53:43	Nancy Ruzycki:	That is an important point, that achieving the certificate is not always the goal for some students
00:55:14	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	1:1 mentoring allows us to check in with mentors (we conduct mid-cohort survey) and schedule a graduation as a final presentation to allow students to reflect on their learning and how that has been for them.
00:57:53	RYAN CROSBY:	THe longer message was just a ramble from me :)
00:59:15	Nancy Ruzycki:	Do you have an office of disability in the UK universities that has the policies for testing and assessment of students with different needs? In the US, they handle the assessment process for students for extra time, space and accommodation for university class assessments.
01:01:41	RYAN CROSBY:	That sounds very interesting Malvika. My PhD was on Ipsative assessment which reminds me of that. It focused more on the students learning gain rather than the final summative assessment. One of the conclusions I came to was that it would be very difficult to do that in current HE, but I try to focus on that in practicals / formative work.
01:01:43	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Ryan your point is absolutely valid: ‚ÄúHowever I am aware that exams are very important to HE institutes and potential employers‚Äù.
01:02:05	Eric Atwell:	If I have a class of 200 students, how can I talk to talk and listen to individual students??
01:02:11	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	I suppose that final exam's success depends on the formative development during the teaching.
01:03:10	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Eric: Written ways to 'listen' is how you can assess everyone's engagement and understanding. Group activities are very useful to manage larger classroom.
01:03:34	Eric Atwell:	@Kate, do you mean ‚Äúwelfare officers‚Äù are needed as separate from ‚Äúlecturers‚Äù?  Should Uni hire more welfare officers and fewer lecturers?
01:03:42	RYAN CROSBY:	@eric - I think thats a discussion around class sizes vs teaching staff. It's alot eaiser to do in modules with 15-30 students. I've taught both types of classes. I found student reflections / peer talks / talking to demonstrators help in the larger classes
01:03:48	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	Thank you so much everyone for joining, and to all of the panelists. I've learned a lot, and it's been great seeing such a lively discussion in the chat. I'm afraid I must dash to my next call, but wish you all the very best for the rest of your weeks. :)
01:03:58	Nick Halper:	If you haven't looked at 'Ungrading' in terms of assessment. It is a growing movement that accomodates many different backgrounds.
01:04:10	staalcu:	I think this is part of the support in place for students around the lectures. We could direct them to the right reference people so that the mechanisms we have in place can start
01:04:23	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	@Nick - do you have any useful links on this? Sounds really interesting
01:04:25	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Very interesting Nick, I did not know about it.
01:04:50	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	https://reflect.ucl.ac.uk/mcarena/2021/05/26/ungrading/
01:05:03	staalcu:	will; this chat be saved?
01:05:18	Nick Halper:	Ungrading: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11O8xqsc_e1Txm-NC_1DAEvLdcFrH3dvzqZZXVORVDmQ/edit
01:05:22	Nancy Ruzycki:	Yes I agree, that the DSO is limited in what they provide. It is a law in the US, but not sure elsewhere
01:05:24	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	Yes it will üôÇ
01:05:38	staalcu:	thanks!
01:06:37	Nancy Ruzycki:	Thanks @nick for the link
01:07:59	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Thanks Ayesha.
01:08:05	Eric Atwell:	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungrading BUT ... University educators MUST deliver a grade for every student in a module
01:08:09	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Sorry to put you on spot. <3
01:08:35	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	‚ù§Ô∏è no thank you for including me!
01:08:50	Kate Hazeldene, OfS:	@Eric-  I think that academic lecturers and student support staff need to be working together to support students from widening participation backgrounds. At the OfS we encourage a whole provider approach to supporting access and participation so it is not a case as more or less of one or the other but how all services collanorate and work together to achieve widening and pariticpation aims 
01:08:55	Nick Halper:	You still get/give a grade, but the formation of that grade is different and customized to the students' participation.
01:08:56	Eric Atwell:	A lot of dscussion - cna you please summarise the main leasons I can take away for today?  eg a list of URLs posted to chat!
01:09:26	Mishka Nemes (she/her) | Alan Turing Institute:	Yes Eric we will do that!
01:09:38	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	@Eric, I will update the HackMD with everything from today and share this on the GitHub repo
