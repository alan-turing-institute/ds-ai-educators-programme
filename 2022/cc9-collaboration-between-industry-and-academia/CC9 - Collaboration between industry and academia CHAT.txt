00:18:20	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Aww. I am sorry Luisa. Thank you for joining. I hope you feel better soon.
00:18:25	Maarya Sharif:	Edinburgh, Scotland only 16¬∞C
00:18:45	Ayesha Dunk (she/her):	Yes - feel better soon Luisa!
00:18:54	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Maarya, It‚Äôs similar in London right now.
00:19:09	Andrew Csizmadia:	17¬∞C with a grey cloud cover here in North Wales.
00:19:19	Riddhima Kedia:	lovely 19C here in Southampton
00:20:34	Nancy Ruzycki:	oh, you are not too hot! that is so nice.
00:28:43	Nancy Ruzycki:	Are simple models sufficient? Would you want them to have more complex model experience with more parameters or are simple models sufficient to show competency?
00:28:51	Maryleen:	Data study groups are amazing!
00:29:43	jakemarshall:	So there is no opportunity for those at 'entry level' then? Those who have just left masters for example will have only done projects in the academic sense, so I imagine it's hard for them to find that hands on experience when they can't get jobs because of a lack of it, if that makes sense?
00:29:51	Eric Atwell:	Q: when you ask ‚Äúhave they built a neural net‚Äù - do you mean ‚Äúhave they implemented a NN algortihm in Python" or do you mean ‚Äúhave they used a state-of-the-art NN python tool, eg AraBERT, to slove a practical task?"
00:31:36	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	Thank you so much for your questions. Please keep them coming in and i'll make sure we get to each of them during the session. üôÇ
00:32:30	Eric Atwell:	We teach Computing and AI  Degree Apprentices at Leeds (Accenture apprentices!), they use existing NN tools and resources (eg in COLAB), is this not relevant to industry?
00:33:26	Maryleen:	Q: What are your thoughts on degree apprenticeships as an initiative to bridge the gap between academia and industry, what are the challenges and opportunities?
00:33:57	Maryleen:	+1 Eric
00:35:02	jakemarshall:	Yes that self awareness of failure as well is really important in a well rounded Data Scientist üòÑ
00:35:13	Luisa Cutillo:	Q: any suggestion on how to approach industry and involve them for hands on experiences with our master students?
00:35:35	jakemarshall:	Yeah absolutely üòõ I wanted to check that those kinds of examples would also be relevant as well, rather than just direct hands on experience! Thanks so much üòÑ
00:37:44	Nancy Ruzycki:	Yes access to large computing resources like GPT3 or a super computer  is difficult for many students in terms of projects even at well resourced universities. There is not equitable access to computing resources which could exclude students from careers.
00:38:38	RYAN CROSBY:	My query would be how does that work with widening participation / edi. Should we in HE not be putting these practical experiences in the course?
00:38:55	Eric Atwell:	Surely ALL AI and Data Science graduates (BSc and MSc) HAVE done practical implementation projects?? This is a requirement for BCS accreditation of our computing degrees at Leeds Uni.  Does Industry value BCS accreditation?
00:38:56	RYAN CROSBY:	What about students who dont have time / ability to do extra outside of the course that they're doing?
00:39:11	Doschmund:	There seems to be more focus on PhDs, Wouldn't that exclude large proportion of capable students at Masters level
00:42:25	Malvika Sharan  (she/her):	Very good point Doschmund.
00:42:29	Eric Atwell:	@Richard - do you mean you bring together AI/DS practitioners with ‚Äúusers‚Äù/‚Äúclients‚Äù who dont have AI/DS expertise? Do all your projects involve non-AI/DS partners?
00:45:22	Maryleen:	Very relatable, Richard. I was a 2020 DSG facilitator. It was a very valuable experience for my career.
00:46:01	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	@Maryleen, that's wonderful to hear. I think our paths crossed during the 2020 DSG.
00:46:46	Maryleen:	Thanks, Matt
00:47:23	Richard Plant:	Thanks Maryleen, I'm very happy it was a good experience for you!
00:48:02	Luisa Cutillo:	@graham do you struggle with different students knowledge background?
00:49:43	Nancy Ruzycki:	Would this have to do with the fact many faculty have had little industry experience or experience with industry problems?
00:50:11	Salomey Afua Addo:	Nancy I think so.
01:03:17	Eric Atwell:	Accenture is a big company.  Does anyone else have experience of link to a small specialist company, eg SketchEngine is a market leader in text  analytics and has long-term collaboration with Leeds and other UK universities in corpus linguistics and text analytics
01:04:36	Doschmund:	@Darren, it is very good to hear that there is focus on inclusivity from Accenture.
01:06:08	Doschmund:	People who work within Industry myself included are well aware of the difficulties in recruiting and retaining skills. There is a significant budget allocated to skill development retention.
01:06:09	Darren Seymour-Russell:	Thank you. It's hard to say this without sounding cliched. But inclusivity and social mobility and hugely important for the company and we work hard to break down barriers - at all levels
01:06:10	RYAN CROSBY:	Thank you for your answers - I know it was a loaded / difficult question
01:06:17	Matt Forshaw (he/him):	https://groupgti.com/ai-scholarships
01:06:28	Nancy Ruzycki:	We work with Citrine in our department to create projects for AI in Materials
01:07:19	Richard Plant:	In terms of projects of varying scale, it might be worth taking a look at the Turing Internship Network: https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/internships
01:07:23	Kieran Baker:	really interesting session, thanks!
01:07:24	Nancy Ruzycki:	thanks
01:07:24	Kwong-Cheong Wong:	Thank you
01:07:26	Noorhan:	Thank you very much
01:07:27	jakemarshall:	Thanks üòÑ
