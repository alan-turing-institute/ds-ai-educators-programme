00:34:16	Eric Atwell:	It's OK, I am already top hit for ‚ÄúEric Atwell" as I have done Search Engine Optimisation myself
00:35:39	Doschmund:	Some companies specifically request certain types of insurances before signing a contract

00:57:31	Eric Atwell:	How do we get funding to support all these roles?  EPSRC funds Research Fellows to develop the core science (eg new AI software) but thn who funds the other  roles??
00:59:57	Eric Atwell:	How can I guess hat users want??
01:00:03	Doschmund:	If the project is small and funding is limited, you could considering the skillset and the benefit that brings, rather than individual roles. In a larger complex project, these are add a lot of value
